# Changelog

All notable changes to TimeTracker will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [5.11.4] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- **Boundary rounding & minimum billable duration (#725)** — Users can round start down / end up to interval boundaries, and set a per-user minimum billable duration. When a user has not customized their interval, the admin `Settings.rounding_minutes` fallback applies.
- **Searchable client/project combobox with inline create (#728)** — Timer and edit forms use a filterable combobox with Create rows; shared modals create clients and projects without leaving the page. Client-only entries no longer force-select the first project.
- **Server-side idle heartbeats (#722)** — Timers track `last_heartbeat_at`; a scheduled job auto-stops forgotten timers when clients go offline. “Still working?” prompts are wired across web, extension, mobile, and desktop, including Socket.IO broadcast beyond web push.

### Fixed

- **Per-user rounding gaps (#725)** — Pomodoro, manual-entry service overrides, CSV/Toggl/Harvest imports, and ActivityWatch no longer store raw `duration_seconds` and skip rounding.
- **Attendance Approve button dropped on submit (#709)** — Disabling the clicked Approve/Reject button during loading no longer strips its `name` from the form, so the decision reaches the server.
- **Chrome extension task/project picker races (#700)** — Stale task loads are discarded with a generation counter; tasks and paginated projects are deduped by id.
- **Idle-tab 503 toasts (#703)** — Dashboard and notification polls are quieted and skipped while the document is hidden so resume no longer sticks on unavailable toasts.
- **Client detail API joinedload (#716)** — `GET /api/v1/clients/<id>` no longer eager-loads the dynamic `Client.projects` relationship (regression coverage added).

### Changed

- **Client versions** — Synced Electron (`desktop/package.json`) and Flutter (`mobile/pubspec.yaml`) to **5.11.4** with the webapp (`setup.py`).

### Documentation

- **Version** — Bumped `setup.py` to **5.11.4** (single source of truth for the application version).
- **Time rounding** — Documented boundary method, minimum billable duration, and admin interval fallback in `docs/TIME_ROUNDING_PREFERENCES.md`.

## [5.11.3] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed

- **Manual-entry rounding uses deprecated query API (#725)** — Replaced `User.query.get` with `db.session.get` when resolving the target user for duration rounding on the manual entry form, silencing the SQLAlchemy 2.x deprecation warning and aligning with the recommended session API.

### Changed

- **Client versions** — Synced Electron (`desktop/package.json`) and Flutter (`mobile/pubspec.yaml`) to **5.11.3** with the webapp (`setup.py`).

### Tests

- Added integration tests for the start-timer 409 conflict payload (#700), transient `calculate_duration` rounding (#725), and explicit manual-entry duration rounding to catch double-apply and override-ignored regressions.

### Documentation

- **Version** — Bumped `setup.py` to **5.11.3** (single source of truth for the application version).

## [5.11.2] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed

- **Attendance correction Approve silently rejected (#709)** — Review forms treated a missing `action` field as Reject, so incomplete POSTs (e.g. pressing Enter in the comment box without a successful submit button) rejected corrections and left history unchanged. Approve/Reject now use distinct button names, a missing decision returns an error instead of rejecting, and applying an approval checks the DB commit and rolls back on failure so history times update reliably.
- **Chrome extension task picker empty for custom Kanban statuses (#700)** — The extension and `status=open` / `status=active` API aliases used a fixed allowlist of statuses, so tasks in custom columns (e.g. `blocked`) never appeared. Open now means “not `done` or `cancelled`” (aligned with `Task.is_active`). The extension requests `status=open`, shows non-todo status next to the task name, reloads tasks when the project filter changes the selection, and still surfaces load errors visibly.
- **Chrome extension task picker missing on-hold tasks (#700)** — Tasks with status `on_hold` are active (`Task.is_active`) and appear in the web UI, but the extension (and the `status=open` / `status=active` API aliases) only included `todo`, `in_progress`, and `review`. On-hold tasks are now included, and the extension surfaces a visible error when the task list fails to load (e.g. missing `read:tasks` scope) instead of showing an empty dropdown.
- **Idle “Still working?” prompt never stopped the timer** — After the idle timeout prompt, dismissing or ignoring it left timers running indefinitely. Web and the browser extension now enforce a 5-minute grace window and auto-stop; the v1 timer API exposes `idle_timeout_minutes` and accepts `stop_time` for accurate stop timestamps.

### Changed

- **Client versions** — Synced Electron (`desktop/package.json`) and Flutter (`mobile/pubspec.yaml`) to **5.11.2** with the webapp (`setup.py`).

### Documentation

- **Version** — Bumped `setup.py` to **5.11.2** (single source of truth for the application version).

## [5.11.1] - 2026-08-06

### Changed

- **Client versions** — Synced Electron (`desktop/package.json`) and Flutter (`mobile/pubspec.yaml`) to **5.11.1** with the webapp (`setup.py`).

### Documentation

- **Version** — Bumped `setup.py` to **5.11.1** (single source of truth for the application version).

## [5.11.0] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- **Auto-deduct break on clock-out** — Admins can opt in to automatically inserting a meal break when a workday exceeds a configurable threshold and insufficient break time was logged, reducing manual corrections for regulated break rules. Enabled via Admin → Settings (new `AUTO_BREAK_DURATION_MINUTES` / `AUTO_BREAK_THRESHOLD_MINUTES` settings; migration `173_add_auto_break_settings`).
- **Smart auto-break fill** — When a partial manual break already exists, only the remaining deficit minutes are inserted on clock-out. Auto-inserted breaks are flagged with `is_auto_break` so they can be distinguished from manual entries.
- **Mobile timer notification (#714)** — Android keeps a foreground-service notification and iOS shows a local notification with project/task name and elapsed time while a timer is running, so users notice forgotten timers.

### Fixed

- **Time correction causes exception (#709)** — Fixed Flask-SocketIO room handlers that called nonexistent `socketio.join_room` / `socketio.leave_room` (use module-level `join_room` / `leave_room` instead). Attendance correction requests now appear on `/workday/history` (requester's own list), on `/approvals` for admins and requesters, and under a new sidebar link **Attendance Corrections**. The "Correct period" form now pre-fills and parses times in the user's timezone.
- **Overnight totals clipped (#706 follow-up)** — Sessions crossing midnight no longer inflate "At work today". Totals are clipped to the requested day, and auto-closed shifts show a dashboard prompt so users can confirm or correct their leave time before starting a new day.
- **Chrome extension task picker empty (#700)** — The popup requested tasks with `status=active`, which is not a valid task status, so existing tasks never appeared in the dropdown. The extension now loads open tasks (`todo`, `in_progress`, `review`) without that filter, and `GET /api/v1/tasks` accepts `status=active` / `open` aliases plus comma-separated status values for older extension builds.
- **Client projects joinedload error (#716)** — `GET /api/v1/clients/<id>` raised `InvalidRequestError` because `joinedload` cannot be applied to a `lazy='dynamic'` relationship.
- **OpenAPI spec missing Tasks and Clients endpoints** — The `/api/openapi.json` document was missing all paths for the Tasks and Clients groups despite the endpoints being fully functional. Added 5 Tasks paths (`/tasks`, `/tasks/{task_id}`) and 14 Clients paths (`/clients`, `/clients/{client_id}`, `/clients/{client_id}/contacts`, `/contacts/{contact_id}`, `/clients/{client_id}/notes`, `/client-notes/{note_id}`, `/clients/{client_id}/invoice-unbilled`). Fixed `Task.priority` schema type from `integer` to `string` enum; expanded `Client` schema from 4 to 16 properties; added `Contact` and `ClientNote` schemas.

### Documentation

- **Version** — Bumped `setup.py` to **5.11.0** (single source of truth for the application version).

## [5.10.1] - 2026-07-25

### Added

- **Forgot overnight clock-out (#706)** — If a workday stays open past midnight, the dashboard and Timer page prompt for the actual leave time so yesterday can be corrected before starting a new day. Smart notifications also warn when an overnight session is still open. `POST /workday/end` and `POST /api/v1/workday/end` accept optional `end_time`.

### Fixed

- **Chrome extension connect did nothing (#700)** — `browser-extension/lib/api.js` was never shipped because root `.gitignore` ignored `lib/`. Connect/Options/background module imports failed silently. The client is now tracked, and Options connect handlers surface unexpected errors.
- **Time entry typing and edit date format (#704 follow-ups)** — Typing `1234` into a time field now becomes `12:34` (not `12:04`). Edit/bulk/calendar date inputs use the user's preferred date format (e.g. DD.MM.YYYY), and edit-page timestamps use `|user_datetime`.
- **Dashboard “At work today” double-count** — Live workday updater no longer adds full session elapsed on top of server hours that already include the active period.

### Changed

- **Client versions** — Synced Electron (`desktop/package.json`) and Flutter (`mobile/pubspec.yaml`) to **5.10.1** with the webapp (`setup.py`).

### Documentation

- **Version** — Documented release **5.10.1** to match `setup.py` (single source of truth for the application version).

## [5.10.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- **Admin book time for others (#701)** — Admins can create manual and bulk time entries (and API v1 creates) on behalf of another active user.
- **Chromium timer extension (#700)** — New `browser-extension/` Manifest V3 package connects to `/api/v1` (same tokens as desktop/mobile), starts/stops timers from the toolbar, shows elapsed time on a red badge/icon, and supports quick-create project/task. Load unpacked from the folder; see `browser-extension/README.md`.
- **Self-hosted frontend assets** — All 17 third-party browser libraries (Font Awesome, Chart.js, flatpickr, Socket.IO, Toast UI Editor, Pickr, Konva, SortableJS, FullCalendar, frappe-gantt, anime.js, cmdk, and the Inter webfont) are now vendored into `app/static/vendor/` from npm instead of being fetched from cdnjs, jsDelivr, uicdn.toast.com and fonts.bunny.net at runtime. The app renders fully with no outbound network access, which makes air-gapped installs work and stops leaking every user's IP address to three CDNs.
- **JavaScript build pipeline** — New esbuild-based build (`scripts/build-js.mjs`) minifies and bundles the previously unbundled scripts into content-hashed files resolved through a new `asset_url()` Jinja helper (`app/utils/assets.py`). The dashboard drops from **32 JS requests / ~550 KB to 12 requests / ~284 KB**.
- **First-run module presets** — The setup wizard asks what you will use TimeTracker for and switches off modules you are unlikely to need. Previously every one of the 41 modules was enabled by default, presenting 80+ navigation destinations on a fresh install. The "Just me" preset enables 12 modules; "A team or agency" 28; "Compliance" 35; "Show me everything" keeps the old behaviour. Existing installs are unaffected, and Admin → Modules still controls everything afterwards.
- **Strict CSP (report-only)** — A nonce-based Content-Security-Policy is now emitted as `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` alongside the enforced policy, so violations are observable before `'unsafe-inline'` is dropped. All 196 inline `<script>` blocks carry a per-request nonce.
- **End-to-end, CSP and accessibility CI** — New Playwright suite (`tests/e2e/`) runs against the real Docker image, asserting zero CSP violations, that the app renders with every external host blocked, an axe-core accessibility baseline, and a JavaScript page-weight budget. CI previously had eight jobs and none of them opened a browser.
- **Regression guards** — `tests/test_no_external_assets.py` fails the build if a CDN reference, remote font `@import`, duplicate Font Awesome load, or un-nonced inline script reappears. `scripts/check_translation_coverage.py` and `scripts/check_silent_excepts.py` add ratchets that may improve but never regress.

### Fixed

- **Desktop and browser lost connection after idle (#702, #703)** — Closing the desktop app with X (tray hide) or leaving a browser tab idle could leave a sticky "connection lost" / "Service temporarily unavailable" state. Session and health probes now recover on success, re-check when the UI becomes visible again, and health checks no longer toast via the service worker's synthetic 503.
- **24h time format preference ignored (#704)** — Native time inputs followed the browser locale (AM/PM). Flatpickr now respects the user's time format preference, and client-side displays use `formatUserTime` / `formatUserDateTime`.
- **Sidebar expand clipped when collapsed (#699)** — Hide the Commands shortcut in the collapsed rail so the expand control stays visible; clarified the onboarding tip (including Ctrl/Cmd+B).
- **Sidebar expand, theme icons, and Ctrl+K** — Collapse control stays reachable when the rail is narrow; theme switcher shows the current mode icon; command palette loads after its markup so Ctrl+K registers.
- **Socket.IO / Flask session crash** — Bumped Flask-SocketIO for Flask 3.1 compatibility; supporter-key verify logging no longer leaks codes; budget alert jobs push a real app context.
- **Multi-key keyboard shortcuts never worked** — `g d`, `g p`, `g t`, `g r` and `g i` were registered but could never fire: the live handler only ever matched a single key combo, and the sequence-buffering logic existed solely in two script files that no template loaded. Added sequence handling to `keyboard-shortcuts-advanced.js`.
- **Font Awesome loaded twice** — Both the CSS build (6.4.0) and the conflicting SVG-with-JS build (6.4.2) were loaded on every page, roughly doubling the icon payload. Four templates loaded *only* the JS build via a `<script>` tag pointing at a stylesheet, which is a no-op.
- **Command palette broke without internet** — `command-palette.js` imported its scoring helper from jsDelivr at runtime, so Ctrl+K silently failed in offline and air-gapped deployments.
- **Contacts navigation was a dead end** — The CRM menu showed "Contacts (via Clients)" as unclickable grey text. It now links to Clients, with a tooltip explaining that contacts are scoped per client.
- **Silenced dashboard errors** — Donation-metric failures on the dashboard were swallowed entirely, so a genuine database fault appeared only as a slow page. Now logged.
- **Inter webfont fetched from a third party** — `input.css` `@import`-ed the font from `fonts.bunny.net` on every page load. Now self-hosted, shipping only the four latin weights actually declared (8 files instead of the package's 126).
- **Tailwind's `hidden` had no effect on icons** — Font Awesome's `.fa-solid { display: inline-block }` and Tailwind's `.hidden { display: none }` have identical specificity, and Font Awesome was loaded last, so it won. Every element combining `hidden` with an `fa-*` class stayed permanently visible — 27 of them, including the theme switcher, which rendered its light, dark *and* system icons at once. Font Awesome now loads before the compiled Tailwind CSS in all eight templates that load both, and a regression test enforces the order.
- **Rich-text editor failed to load** — Toast UI Editor threw `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'PluginKey')` on all ten screens that use it. The npm package's UMD build declares the eight `prosemirror-*` packages as webpack *externals* and `require()`s them at runtime, so they were undefined in the browser; the CDN file it replaced was the "all" build with those dependencies bundled in, which npm does not publish. A genuinely self-contained bundle is now produced from the package's ESM entry by `scripts/build-js.mjs`.
- **CSP Report-Only was inert and drowned the console** — It had no `report-uri`, so browsers had nowhere to send violations ("will not block and cannot report violations"), and because `script-src-attr` was undeclared it fell back to `script-src`, making all ~547 inline event handlers violate on every page load. The policy now declares `script-src-attr 'unsafe-inline'` so it reports only what nonces actually fix, and posts violations to a new rate-limited `/csp-report` endpoint.

### Changed

- **nginx** — `Connection` on the `/socket.io/` proxy is now set conditionally via a `map` instead of being hardcoded to `upgrade`, which is the documented pattern for mixing WebSocket and HTTP long-polling. (This was investigated as the cause of `/socket.io/` handshakes returning HTTP 400; an A/B test returned 200 with both the old and new header, so that report remains open.) Added `gzip` for text assets, which matters now that vendored libraries are served exactly as their packages ship them (the Toast UI bundle compresses 580 KB → 209 KB).
- **`base.html` split into partials** — Reduced from 2,614 to ~1,267 lines by extracting `partials/_head.html`, `_sidebar.html` and `_topbar.html`, and relocating 309 lines of inline CSS into `app/static/src/input.css`.
- **Removed ~4,800 lines of dead frontend code** — Ten static assets and one duplicate macro library that no template referenced: `commands.js`, `global-fab.js`, `keyboard-shortcuts.js`, `keyboard-shortcuts-enhanced.js`, `quick-actions.js`, `reports-enhanced.js`, `kiosk-mode.css`, `ui-enhancements.css`, `css/brand-colors.css`, `css/rtl-support.css`, `templates/_components.html`, plus eight unused `pdf_editor/*.mjs` re-export stubs.
- **CSP no longer allowlists any third party** — Removed six CDN origins plus stale `code.jquery.com` and `cdn.datatables.net` entries, and added `object-src 'none'`, `base-uri 'self'` and `form-action 'self'`.
- **Client versions** — Synced Electron (`desktop/package.json`) and Flutter (`mobile/pubspec.yaml`) to **5.10.0** with the webapp (`setup.py`).

### Documentation

- **Version** — Documented release **5.10.0** to match `setup.py` (single source of truth for the application version).

## [5.9.4] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- **Desktop app catch-up** — Timer pause/resume (incl. tray), Reports summary view, workday/attendance controls matching mobile, Kanban board, CRM (leads/deals/contacts/notes), and finance depth (payments, mileage, quotes, recurring invoices, credit notes). See [DESKTOP_WEBAPP_GAP.md](docs/mobile-desktop-apps/DESKTOP_WEBAPP_GAP.md).
- **Mobile app catch-up** — Calendar, Kanban, CRM hub, clients, issues, mileage, per diem, Belgium report, and deeper project/task flows aligned with the webapp.
- **Issues API (v1)** — Exposed issues endpoints on the REST API for mobile and desktop clients.

### Changed

- **Desktop docs** — Auth docs now describe username/password login and the React+Vite renderer.
- **Client versions** — Synced Electron (`desktop/package.json`) and Flutter (`mobile/pubspec.yaml`) to **5.9.4** with the webapp (`setup.py`).

### Documentation

- **Version** — Documented release **5.9.4** to match `setup.py` (single source of truth for the application version).

## [5.9.3] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- **Kanban WIP limits** — Per-column work-in-progress limits on Kanban boards.
- **Task checklists** — Per-task checklists and subtasks on the Kanban board.
- **Kanban board templates** — Save and reuse board layouts as templates.
- **Comment @mentions** — Teammates are notified when mentioned in task comments.
- **Docker Hub automation** — Release workflow (`cd-release.yml`) now auto-publishes the repository description from `docker/hub-README.md` (with current version injected). Development builds (`cd-development.yml`) also push the `develop` tag to Docker Hub when credentials are configured.

### Changed

- **Docker Hub publish resilience** — Release and development workflows only push to Docker Hub when `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and token/password secrets are set; GHCR-only builds no longer fail on missing Docker Hub credentials.

### Fixed

- **Client portal sessions** — Native client portal users stay in the portal UI after login instead of being redirected to the main app ([#677](https://github.com/DRYTRIX/TimeTracker/issues/677)).
- **Calendar holiday overlays** — Holiday overlays now appear correctly in day and week views.
- **Workday history dates** — Fixed date formatting on the workday history page.

### Documentation

- **Version** — Documented release **5.9.3** to match `setup.py` (single source of truth for the application version).

## [5.9.2] - 2026-07-13

### Added

- **Distribution hub** — [DISTRIBUTION.md](docs/admin/deployment/DISTRIBUTION.md) consolidates install paths for Docker, NAS, PaaS (Render, Railway, Fly.io, Coolify), Unraid, and Portainer.
- **Portainer app templates** — One-click stack in Portainer via `templates/portainer/templates.json`.
- **Unraid Community Applications** — App templates for the TimeTracker app and PostgreSQL database.
- **PaaS deploy configs** — `fly.toml` and `railway.toml` for Fly.io and Railway one-click deploys.
- **Docker Hub README** — `docker/hub-README.md` for the Docker Hub repository page.

### Changed

- **Docker Hub namespace** — Images now publish to `drytrix/timetracker` (replacing `driesp/timetracker`). CI release workflow, deploy scripts, and docs updated accordingly.

### Documentation

- **Version** — Documented release **5.9.2** to match `setup.py` (single source of truth for the application version).

## [5.9.1] - 2026-07-13

### Fixed

- **Calendar holiday and time-off overlays** — Restored holiday overlays on `/calendar` via a dedicated `/api/calendar/data` feed (avoids route collision with `/api/calendar/events`). Fixed local date keying, merged overlay handling, and FullCalendar overlay end dates.
- **Dashboard working-time limit banner** — Banner now appears only when justifications are pending.
- **Attendance compliance** — Stopped eager loading of dynamic attendance relationships that caused regressions in `list_days`.
- **Template globals** — Fixed `Settings` shadowing in Jinja template globals.

### Documentation

- **NAS deployment** — Added `docker-compose.nas.yml` and [NAS_DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/admin/deployment/NAS_DEPLOYMENT.md) for QNAP, Synology, and Portainer installs without cloning the repo.
- **Calendar API** — Documented `/api/calendar/data` endpoint in calendar feature docs.
- **Version** — Documented release **5.9.1** to match `setup.py` (single source of truth for the application version).

## [5.9.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- **Belgium 2027 attendance compliance** — Optional attendance compliance module with Belgium preset (daily/weekly hours, break and rest rules, 10-year retention). Employees clock in/out and track breaks via workday flows; corrections require admin approval; workforce CSV export and mobile API support inspector-ready records. See [BELGIUM_2027.md](docs/compliance/BELGIUM_2027.md).
- **Missed workday reminders** — Smart notification and optional email when an employee has not pressed **Start Workday** on an expected work day (Mon–Fri, excluding holidays and approved time off). User settings under **Settings → Notifications**; migration `165_add_missed_clock_in_notifications`. See [SMART_NOTIFICATIONS.md](docs/features/SMART_NOTIFICATIONS.md) and [WORKDAY_SESSIONS.md](docs/features/WORKDAY_SESSIONS.md).
- **Attendance correction for missing workdays** — Employees can request admin-approved retroactive work periods from `/workday/history` when they forgot to clock in on a past day.
- **Time-off request PDF** — Printable leave/vacation form with employee details, approval metadata, and signature lines. Download from the Workforce dashboard (`/workforce/time-off/<id>/pdf`) or `GET /api/v1/time-off/requests/<id>/pdf`.
- **Calendar holidays and time-off overlay** — Company holidays and the user's time-off (approved and pending) appear on the main calendar and timer calendar views with filter toggles.
- **Mobile workday controls** — Shared **Workday** card on Home and Timer screens with error feedback via SnackBar.
- **Slack attendance commands** — Workspace-level `/in`, `/brb`, `/back`, `/out` slash commands for clock-in/out and breaks in a dedicated Slack channel, with in-channel confirmations and email/Slack-ID user linking. Admin setup under **Integrations → Workspace integrations**; migration `166_add_slack_user_id`. See [SLACK_ATTENDANCE.md](docs/integrations/SLACK_ATTENDANCE.md).

### Fixed

- **Client portal login and logout (#677)** — External clients with portal credentials can sign in at `/login` as well as `/client-portal/login`; wrong passwords no longer fall through to self-registration. Portal logout (native and user-based sessions) redirects to `/client-portal/login`. Portal usernames are matched case-insensitively. See [CLIENT_PORTAL.md](docs/CLIENT_PORTAL.md).

### Documentation

- **Version** — Documented release **5.9.0** to match `setup.py` (single source of truth for the application version).

## [5.8.6] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- **Portal-only users** — Internal user accounts can be restricted to the client portal via a new **Portal only** option (`users.portal_only`). Such users are redirected away from the main app UI to `/client-portal` after login. The admin user form clarifies that enabling Client Portal alone does not restrict main app access. See [CLIENT_PORTAL.md](docs/CLIENT_PORTAL.md).
- **Deleted username blocklist** — Deleting a user now reserves the username in a new `deleted_usernames` table, preventing the account from being recreated through self-registration, OIDC, or LDAP provisioning. Admin-created accounts are exempt. See [USER_DELETION.md](docs/features/USER_DELETION.md).

### Fixed

- **Peppol (Peppyrus)** — Authenticate API requests with the `X-Api-Key` header instead of `Authorization: Bearer`, matching the Peppyrus API. See [PEPPOL_BRIDGE.md](docs/admin/configuration/PEPPOL_BRIDGE.md).
- **Client portal access** — Portal access is now denied when the user or the assigned client is inactive, and native client login clears stale main-app session keys to avoid session/preference conflicts.
- **Client portal payments** — The payment-success page now confirms based on the gateway capture or invoice payment status, showing a "processing" message when payment is not yet fully settled.
- **Client portal documents** — Attachment downloads require an explicit `type=client|project` parameter to avoid ID collisions between the client and project attachment tables.
- **Client portal actions** — Approvals, rejections, and project comments fall back to an auto-created portal contact when a client has none, and the notification mark-as-read flow now redirects with a flash message.
- **Client portal currency** — Dashboard and report summaries display the invoice currency instead of assuming a fixed code.
- **Admin user roles** — Editing a user now replaces the full role set with the selected role, preventing stale roles from lingering.

### Documentation

- **Version** — Documented release **5.8.6** to match `setup.py` (single source of truth for the application version).

## [5.8.5] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- **Invoice time entries and expenses (#662)** — Clearer UX separates logged hours (Invoice Items) from expense-module records (Expenses section). Generate-from-time shows diagnostic hints when no entries are available, excludes entries already on the invoice, and aligns billed-entry detection across client invoices. Optional **one line per time entry** preserves individual descriptions; admin setting controls default grouping.

- **Manual time entry task dropdown** — Fixed a JavaScript initialization error on `/timer/manual` that prevented the task list from loading when a project was selected ([#675](https://github.com/DRYTRIX/TimeTracker/issues/675)).

### Documentation

- **Version** — Documented release **5.8.5** to match `setup.py` (single source of truth for the application version).

## [5.8.4] - 2026-06-19

### Fixed

- **Workflow template migration** — Migration 161 no longer queries `users.is_admin` (a model property, not a database column), fixing PostgreSQL deploy failures when seeding starter workflow templates.

### Documentation

- **Version** — Documented release **5.8.4** to match `setup.py` (single source of truth for the application version).

## [5.8.3] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- **Peppol bridge** — Self-hosted Peppol adapter with setup wizard and provider presets; see [PEPPOL_BRIDGE.md](docs/admin/configuration/PEPPOL_BRIDGE.md).
- **Accounting integrations** — Sync configuration and integration metadata for accounting exports.
- **Payments** — Provider registry and unified checkout flow.
- **Workflows** — Template library and event bridge for automation.
- **Invoices** — Service helpers for API detail, line items, and PDF generation.
- **Analytics** — Profitability dashboard and utilization forecast.
- **Reports** — Invoice data source for scheduled reports.
- **CalDAV** — All-day event handling and sync-loop prevention.
- **Desktop app** — Minimize-to-tray, keyboard shortcuts, and richer views.
- **Mobile app** — Invoice detail screen and expanded finance APIs.

### Documentation

- **Version** — Documented release **5.8.3** to match `setup.py` (single source of truth for the application version).

## [5.8.2] - 2026-06-15

### Fixed

- **Invoice expenses** — Expense records from the Expenses module now link to the invoice Expenses section instead of being misrouted into invoice items or lost on save. Generate-from-time no longer wipes existing line items when only expenses are selected; the Add Expense flow focuses the expenses picker; edit-time expense sync is hardened (#662).

### Documentation

- **Version** — Documented release **5.8.2** to match `setup.py` (single source of truth for the application version).

## [5.8.1] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed

- **Quote email** — Sending a quote by email no longer shows a false error after delivery; the send route now matches the util’s `(success, message)` return tuple instead of unpacking three values (#652).

### Documentation

- **Version** — Documented release **5.8.1** to match `setup.py` (single source of truth for the application version).

## [5.8.0] - 2026-06-07

### Added

- **Configurable quote numbering** — Admin settings now mirror invoice numbering: prefix, number pattern, and start number. Quotes use the shared document numbering engine instead of a hardcoded `QUO-YYYYMMDD-NNN` format (migration **159**).

### Fixed

- **Quote email** — Sending a quote by email no longer fails with “recipient required” when submitted from the web form; empty recipient falls back to the client email, and validation errors redirect with a flash instead of raw JSON (#652).
- **Invoice from time entries** — Creating an invoice from time entries no longer fails with a missing `invoice_id` on line items, and totals are recomputed from persisted line items instead of staying at zero.
- **Payment delete** — Deleting a payment now correctly updates invoice payment status (flush delete before recomputing totals; unpaid invoices no longer read as fully paid).
- **Audit listeners** — SQLAlchemy flush listeners register once per process, preventing duplicate audit callbacks and CPU hangs when many Flask apps are created in one process (e.g. parallel pytest).

### Changed

- **Invoice send email** — Form POST handling aligned with quote send-email (consistent form/JSON read path).

### Documentation

- **Client reply template** — Refreshed `docs/CLIENT_EMAIL_WORKDAY_FEATURES.md` for workday sessions and working time limits rollout.
- **Version** — Documented release **5.8.0** to match `setup.py` (single source of truth for the application version).

## [5.7.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- **Workday sessions** — Employees can **Start Workday** / **End Workday** on the dashboard and timer page without a project or client. Hours at work are tracked separately from project time entries so totals are never double-counted (`WorkdaySession`, `WorkdaySessionService`, migration `158`).
- **Working time limits** — Configurable daily and weekly hour caps (admin settings and per-user overrides). Soft enforcement: email notification when exceeded, in-app justification workflow, and admin review at `/admin/working-time` (`WorkingTimeViolation`, APScheduler job every 15 minutes).
- **REST API and kiosk** — `GET/POST /api/v1/workday/*` and kiosk `start-workday` / `end-workday` endpoints.

### Documentation

- **[Workday sessions and working time limits](docs/features/WORKDAY_SESSIONS.md)** — User and admin guide.
- **[REST API](docs/api/REST_API.md)** — Workday session endpoints.
- **Client reply template** — `docs/CLIENT_EMAIL_WORKDAY_FEATURES.md`.
- **Version** — Documented release **5.7.0** to match `setup.py` (single source of truth for the application version).

## [5.6.3] - 2026-05-24

### Fixed

- **Comment API update/delete** — v1 `PATCH`/`DELETE /comments/<id>` no longer return 500: handlers eager-load `Comment.author` (not the non-existent `user` relationship). Comment edits now persist reliably — `edit_content()` no longer calls `now_in_app_timezone()` before commit, which could roll back the session when no `Settings` row exists and discard content changes while `updated_at` still advanced (`app/models/comment.py`, `app/routes/api_v1.py`).

### Added

- **German translations** — Updated `translations/de/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po` with community translation improvements.

### Documentation

- **Version** — Documented release **5.6.3** to match `setup.py` (single source of truth for the application version).

## [5.6.2] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed

- **Invoice PDF designer Items Table alignment (#622, follow-up)** — Fixed the regression where exported tables were still misaligned after the color fix: text and images use page-absolute coordinates on the PDF canvas, but tables were laid out in the margin-adjusted flow area (`left_offset = x − margin`), so a table at `x=40` appeared at the content edge (~57pt) while the preview showed 40pt. Items/expenses tables are now drawn on the canvas at template `(x, y)` via `wrap`/`drawOn`, with width capped to the remaining page width. The template editor serializes table groups with `getClientRect()` so moved/scaled tables match saved JSON. **Generate Preview** for invoice and quote PDFs now returns the same ReportLab PDF bytes as export (HTML preview remains fallback). Header/row colors and column alignment continue to use per-cell `ParagraphStyle`; `hAlign = LEFT` is retained (`app/utils/pdf_generator_reportlab.py`, `app/routes/admin.py`, `app/templates/admin/pdf_layout.html`, `app/templates/admin/quote_pdf_layout.html`).

### Tests

- **Invoice PDF template Items Table** — `tests/test_invoice_pdf_template_table.py` covers colors, alignment, `rowBackground`, canvas story collection, page-bound width capping, and PDF generation when table `x` is below the left margin.

### Documentation

- **Version** — Documented release **5.6.2** to match `setup.py` (single source of truth for the application version).

## [5.6.1] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed

- **Docker / PDF build** — Bumped `pydyf` to 0.12.1 for compatibility with WeasyPrint 68 in container builds.
- **Security** — Upgraded `PyJWT` to 2.12.1 (RFC 7515 `crit` validation, CVE-2026-32597) and `markdown` to 3.8.1 (DoS fixes).

### Changed

- **Docker build context** — Added `.dockerignore` to exclude local `.venv` and shrink image build context.

### Documentation

- **Version** — Documented release **5.6.1** to match `setup.py` (single source of truth for the application version).

## [5.6.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added

- **Personal integration connectors — GitHub, Google Calendar, Slack** — Three new per-user, opt-in connectors that subclass `app/integrations/base.py` and persist their config inside the existing `Integration.config` JSONB (no new tables, all secrets encrypted at rest). The new `app/routes/integrations_webhooks.py` blueprint exposes signature-verified webhook receivers (`POST /api/integrations/github/webhook` with `X-Hub-Signature-256`, `POST /api/integrations/slack/events` with `X-Slack-Signature`), the Google OAuth flow (`/integrations/google/{connect,callback,disconnect}`), and a uniform `config`/`status`/`test`/`sync` API surface for each provider. GitHub auto-creates tasks on `issues.opened`, marks them done on `issues.closed`, and (optionally) starts a timer on `issues.assigned` for the linked TimeTracker user (`users.github_username`). Google Calendar supports `import` / `export` / `both` directions with token refresh inside a 5-minute window and a 30-minute scheduled sync (`google_calendar_sync` APScheduler job). Slack posts a stopwatch/checkmark message on every timer start/stop (fire-and-forget hook in `app/routes/timer.py` and `app/routes/api.py`), implements the `/tt` slash command (`start [project]` / `stop` / `status` / `today`), and posts a configurable daily summary (`slack_daily_summary` APScheduler job, every 30 minutes). Three new cards in **Settings → Integrations → Personal connectors** drive the UI (`app/templates/integrations/_connector_cards.html`, vanilla JS + Tailwind). New migration `155_add_integration_columns` adds `users.github_username` and an indexed `tasks.external_ref` for de-duplicating webhook events. Every connector degrades gracefully — when the `Integration` row is missing or `is_active=False` all methods return `{"ok": false, "error": "Integration not configured"}` without raising. See [docs/integrations/GITHUB_CONNECTOR.md](docs/integrations/GITHUB_CONNECTOR.md), [docs/integrations/GOOGLE_CALENDAR.md](docs/integrations/GOOGLE_CALENDAR.md), and [docs/integrations/SLACK.md](docs/integrations/SLACK.md).
- **Custom themes** — Per-user theme picker under **Settings → Custom theme**. Eight built-in themes (`default`, `ocean`, `forest`, `sunset`, `lavender`, `rose`, `slate`, `high-contrast`) plus four independent overrides: accent colour (10 presets or any `#RRGGBB`), sidebar style (default/compact/minimal hover-expand), text size (sm/base/lg) and corner radius (sharp/rounded/pill). Live preview swaps a `<style id="tt-theme-vars">` block via `GET` / `POST /api/user/theme`; preferences persist on the `users` table via migration `156_add_user_theme_columns`. Default theme injects no CSS at all so existing users see zero visual change until they opt in. Backed by `ThemeService` (`app/services/theme_service.py`) and the self-contained `components/theme_picker.html` component (vanilla JS, no framework). See [docs/features/CUSTOM_THEMES.md](docs/features/CUSTOM_THEMES.md).
- **Personal productivity dashboard** — New **My productivity** page at `/dashboard/productivity` (sidebar link) with today/week summary, streaks, 14-day hours chart, project doughnut, focus stats, 12-week activity heatmap, and insight cards. Backed by `ProductivityService` (user-timezone-aware) and `GET /api/productivity/stats` (`period` 1–90 days, 5-minute cache when no active timer). See [docs/features/PRODUCTIVITY_DASHBOARD.md](docs/features/PRODUCTIVITY_DASHBOARD.md).
- **AI time entry suggestions** — `GET /api/ai/suggest` returns deterministic (and optional LLM-rich) project/task/notes suggestions. Wired into the Start Timer modal (`components/ai_suggestions.html`) and manual entry **Autofill** (`js/ai_autocomplete.js`) when the AI helper is enabled.
- **Project forecast panel** — `ForecastService` and `GET /api/projects/<id>/forecast` (deterministic metrics plus optional `?ai=true` narrative; 10-minute in-process cache). Self-contained card on active projects with estimated hours or budget. Documented in [docs/BUDGET_ALERTS_AND_FORECASTING.md](docs/BUDGET_ALERTS_AND_FORECASTING.md) and [docs/features/PROJECT_DASHBOARD.md](docs/features/PROJECT_DASHBOARD.md).
- **Smart reminders: break, end-of-day, and idle toasts** — Extends smart in-app notifications with optional **break reminder** (Pomodoro-style nudge every N minutes while a timer runs, 15–240 min) and **end-of-day wrap-up** (hours logged today in a configurable hour window). New kinds `break_reminder` and `end_of_day_reminder` in `NotificationService`; user prefs under **Settings → Notifications**; migration `154_add_smart_notify_break_and_eod`. [`app/static/idle.js`](app/static/idle.js) shows blue/purple/green toasts for no-tracking, break, and end-of-day (alongside existing idle stop-timer prompt). APScheduler job `smart_reminder_push` (every 15 min) sends browser push for eligible users when VAPID and push subscriptions are available. Env default `SMART_NOTIFY_END_OF_DAY_AT` (`17:00`). See [docs/features/SMART_NOTIFICATIONS.md](docs/features/SMART_NOTIFICATIONS.md).

### Documentation

- **Version** — Documented release **5.6.0** to match `setup.py` (single source of truth for the application version).

## [5.5.7] - 2026-05-14

### Fixed

- **Invoice PDF designer layout** — Restored the missing canvas-area wrapper in the invoice PDF designer so the properties panel sits in the third grid column beside the canvas instead of stacking below it (`app/templates/admin/pdf_layout.html`).
- **Invoice PDF preview vs export (#622)** — The JSON-to-HTML preview path now uses the same table style keys as export (header and row text, row background, border width) so the preview matches generated PDFs.

### Changed

- **Designer template JSON and ReportLab export** — Saving template JSON from the designer reads items-table and expenses-table width, colors, and separator line settings from the Konva group children; column widths scale to the chosen table width and a style block is emitted for ReportLab (`app/routes/admin.py`, `pdf_layout.html`).
- **ReportLab invoice tables** — Column widths scale to `element.width`; tables are wrapped in a two-column outer table so horizontal offset from the left margin is honored; `borderColor` and `borderWidth` from template style are applied (`app/utils/pdf_generator_reportlab.py`).

### Documentation

- **Version** — Documented release **5.5.7** to match `setup.py` (single source of truth for the application version).

## [5.5.6] - 2026-05-14

### Documentation

- **Uninstall / AI** — Expanded [UNINSTALL.md](UNINSTALL.md) with a dedicated **Disabling or removing the AI helper** section (admin UI, `.env`, Docker `ai` profile, `ollama_data` volume vs full `down -v`, API token scopes `read:ai` / `write:ai`, hosted provider keys).
- **Version** — Documented release **5.5.6** to match `setup.py` (single source of truth for the application version).

## [5.5.5] - 2026-05-12

### Fixed

- **Main column layout and footer alignment** — Removed an extra closing `</div>` in `{% block content %}` on admin backups, admin API tokens, and quote detail templates. Invalid HTML caused the browser to recover by closing ancestor nodes early (including `#mainContent`), leaving modals and page chrome mis-nested so the authenticated “Built by an independent developer” line no longer lined up with the content column.

### Changed

- **App shell uses full main-column width** — `base.html` no longer caps `<main id="mainContentAnchor">` or the attribution line with `max-w-7xl`; the main area and support banner inner row span the width beside the sidebar (padding unchanged). `<main>` and the footer line sit in a shared `flex-1 flex flex-col min-w-0 w-full` wrapper so the column grows vertically with the layout.

## [5.5.4] - 2026-05-11

### Fixed

- **Full database restore** — Admin restore cleanup no longer uses `current_app` from a background thread outside Flask application context. While `restore_backup` runs (archive extract through Alembic upgrade), the app sets `_database_restore_in_progress`; the client portal global context processor skips non-essential database reads during that window and rolls back the session on `SQLAlchemyError` so login and error pages can render when PostgreSQL schema is briefly torn during `pg_restore --clean`.

### Documentation

- **Backup and restore** — Added [docs/admin/BACKUP_AND_RESTORE.md](docs/admin/BACKUP_AND_RESTORE.md) and cross-links from the admin index, [DATABASE_RECOVERY.md](DATABASE_RECOVERY.md), and import/export guides for operational behaviour during restore.

## [5.5.3] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed
- **Approvals status values stored correctly** — `ClientApprovalStatus` values are now bound to the Postgres enum values (not the Python enum member names), preventing mismatches between API payloads/UI state and the persisted status.
- **Clients view delete-note confirmation** — Removed a nested `<script>` tag that could orphan `confirmDeleteNote`, causing delete confirmation to break in the clients view.

## [5.5.2] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed
- **Quote edit redirect for delegated editors** — Users with `edit_quotes` permission could save changes on draft quotes they did not create but were redirected to an empty/“not found” flow because quote detail/list visibility was still filtered by `created_by`. Quote list/detail scope now matches edit capability for users with `edit_quotes` across web and API quote reads. Added a regression test for edit-then-redirect view loading and updated quote comment edit context links.

## [5.5.0] - 2026-04-27

### Added
- **LDAP authentication** — Optional directory login via `AUTH_METHOD=ldap` or combined `AUTH_METHOD=all` (with local + OIDC). New `LDAP_*` settings in `app/config.py`, `LDAPService` (`app/services/ldap_service.py`), login and password-reset behaviour keyed off `users.auth_provider` (`local` | `oidc` | `ldap`), admin **System Settings** LDAP panel and `POST /admin/ldap/test`, production env validation for required LDAP variables, Alembic `153_add_user_auth_provider`, and tests in `tests/test_ldap_auth.py`. Dependency: `ldap3`. Documentation: [docs/admin/configuration/LDAP_SETUP.md](docs/admin/configuration/LDAP_SETUP.md); OIDC and getting-started guides updated for `ldap` / `all`.

### Fixed
- **Admin “Allow only one active timer per user” ignored at runtime** — Timer start and related flows always blocked a second running entry and never read `Settings.single_active_timer` from the database. Enforcement now uses `Settings.get_settings()` via `TimeTrackingService.can_start_timer` (web timer routes, REST v1, kiosk start, legacy session `POST /api/timer/resume`). `POST /api/v1/timer/start` returns **409** with `error_code: timer_already_running` when the setting is on and a timer is already running. `SINGLE_ACTIVE_TIMER` still seeds new installs only. Tests: `tests/test_single_active_timer_setting.py`.
- **API integration test for project tasks** — `tests/test_api_comprehensive.py` now matches `GET /api/projects/<id>/tasks`, which returns **all** tasks (including done and cancelled) for the time-entry UI.
- **Quote create returned HTTP 500 after save (#583)** — The quote was saved, but the redirect to the quote detail page crashed when **Valid until** was set: the template compared `valid_until` to `now()`, and `now` was never defined in the Jinja context. The expired badge now uses `Quote.is_expired` (same rule, app timezone). Regression coverage in `tests/test_routes/test_quotes_web.py` posts `valid_until` so the view path is exercised.
- **Desktop app navigation guard** — `will-navigate` no longer mis-classifies `file:` loads (opaque `"null"` origin) as external navigation. Allowed in-app protocols include `file:`, `about:`, and `devtools:`; `http:` / `https:` are still blocked from the embedded window.
- **Desktop offline UI (bundle)** — Shared helpers load before dependent modules; timesheet period and time-off request lists expose **Delete** where allowed (with `currentUserProfile.id` for ownership); approve/reject controls read approval state from `state.currentUserProfile`; API client includes `deleteTimesheetPeriod` and `deleteTimeOffRequest`.

### Added
- **Mobile bottom navigation (web)** — On viewports below the `md` breakpoint (768px), signed-in users get a fixed bottom bar with tabs for Dashboard, Timer, Time entries, Projects, and **More**. **More** opens a slide-up drawer (backdrop, close control, Escape) linking to Invoices, Clients, Reports, and **My Settings** (`user.settings`), respecting module enablement where applicable. Implementation: [`app/templates/partials/_bottom_nav.html`](app/templates/partials/_bottom_nav.html) included from [`app/templates/base.html`](app/templates/base.html); [`app/static/mobile.js`](app/static/mobile.js) drives the drawer. **Safe area:** `pb-safe` utility in [`app/static/src/input.css`](app/static/src/input.css) and safelist in [`tailwind.config.js`](tailwind.config.js). Main content uses `pb-16` on small screens so it is not covered by the bar. Layout breakpoint for sidebar visibility, main margin, mobile menu, and RTL `#mainContent` margin is aligned to `md` (768px).
- **Smart in-app notifications** — Opt-in under **Settings → Notifications → In-app reminders**: nudge when no time is logged today (configurable hour window, user timezone), alert when an active timer exceeds a configurable duration, and end-of-day summary of hours logged. Server-driven via `GET /api/notifications` and `POST /api/notifications/dismiss`; per-day dismissals stored in `user_smart_notification_dismissals`. Environment defaults: `SMART_NOTIFY_MAX_PER_DAY`, `SMART_NOTIFY_NO_TRACKING_AFTER`, `SMART_NOTIFY_SUMMARY_AT`, `SMART_NOTIFY_LONG_TIMER_HOURS`, `SMART_NOTIFY_SCHEDULER_SLOT_MINUTES` (see `app/config.py` and [docs/features/SMART_NOTIFICATIONS.md](docs/features/SMART_NOTIFICATIONS.md)). Migration `150_add_smart_notifications`. The dashboard client polls the API and shows toasts (optional browser notifications when enabled and permission granted). `toastManager.show` supports an optional `onDismiss` callback.
- **Value dashboard widget** — Dashboard productivity block backed by `StatsService` and `GET /api/stats/value-dashboard` (short-TTL Redis cache when available). Wired from `dashboard-enhancements.js` with the existing real-time dashboard refresh.
- **Quote line item reorder (Issue #584)** — Non-null `quote_items.position` (migration `146_add_quote_item_position`); `Quote.items` is ordered by `position`, then `id`. Create, edit, duplicate, bulk duplicate, API item payloads, and quote-template apply assign positions from the submitted row order. **Create quote** and **edit quote** forms include per-row **Move up** / **Move down** controls on **Quote line items**, **Costs**, and **Extra goods** so rows can be reordered without deleting and re-entering data; PDFs and detail views follow the saved order. New translatable UI strings: **Order**, **Move up**, **Move down** (run `pybabel extract` / `update` per [docs/CONTRIBUTING_TRANSLATIONS.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING_TRANSLATIONS.md)).
- **Offline queue replay** — Queued requests now store method, headers, and body in a replay-safe form (serializable for localStorage). POST/PUT requests replayed when back online send the same body and method. Legacy queue items (with `options` only) are still replayed via fallback.
- **Inventory API scopes** — New scopes `read:inventory` and `write:inventory` for inventory-only API access. Existing `read:projects` and `write:projects` still grant the same inventory access for backward compatibility.
- **Client portal reports: date range and CSV export** — Reports support optional `days` query param (1–365, default 30). Add `?format=csv` to download a CSV of the same report (summary, hours by project, time by date). Export uses the same access control as the reports page.
- **Jira webhook verification** — When a webhook secret is configured in the Jira integration (Connection Settings → Webhook Secret), incoming webhooks are verified using HMAC-SHA256 of the request body. Supported headers: `X-Hub-Signature-256`, `X-Atlassian-Webhook-Signature`, `X-Hub-Signature`. Requests with missing or invalid signature are rejected. If no secret is set, behavior is unchanged (all webhooks accepted).
- **Crowdin integration (maintainers)** — Root [`crowdin.yml`](crowdin.yml) maps `translations/en/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po` to per-locale `messages.po` paths (with `nb` → `no` for Norwegian). Manual [`.github/workflows/crowdin-sync.yml`](.github/workflows/crowdin-sync.yml) uploads sources and downloads translations when `CROWDIN_PROJECT_ID` and `CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN` are set. [docs/CONTRIBUTING_TRANSLATIONS.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING_TRANSLATIONS.md) includes a Crowdin setup section; [docs/TRANSLATION_SYSTEM.md](docs/TRANSLATION_SYSTEM.md) and contributor docs cross-link it.

### Changed
- **Documentation (API)** — Documented session-auth `GET /api/stats/value-dashboard` (response fields, Redis TTL, rate resolution) in [`docs/api/REST_API.md`](docs/api/REST_API.md) and linked dashboard session JSON from [`docs/API.md`](docs/API.md).
- **API v1 search scoping** — Project, task, and client branches of token search use shared `apply_project_scope` and `apply_client_scope` query helpers in [`app/utils/scope_filter.py`](app/utils/scope_filter.py) for consistent subcontractor restrictions.
- **Documentation (translations)** — Added [docs/CONTRIBUTING_TRANSLATIONS.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING_TRANSLATIONS.md) for contributors without Git (issue template, optional spreadsheet or hosted platform, maintainer workflow). Root [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) links to it; [docs/TRANSLATION_SYSTEM.md](docs/TRANSLATION_SYSTEM.md) defers the enabled locale list to `app/config.py` (`LANGUAGES`) and points translators at the new guide.
- **Factur-X / PDF/A-3 invoice PDFs (export and email)** — Download and email attachments use the same embed-and-normalize path. Embedded CII uses Associated File relationship **Data** and MIME **text/xml**. PDF/A-3 normalization embeds sRGB via `app/resources/icc/` (override with `INVOICE_SRGB_ICC_PATH`). Added `app/utils/invoice_pdf_postprocess.py` and tests; [PEPPOL e-Invoicing](docs/admin/configuration/PEPPOL_EINVOICING.md) updated (veraPDF note, pytest command).
- **Documentation sync** — CODEBASE_AUDIT.md: marked gaps 2.3–2.7 and 2.9 as fixed; added “Implemented 2026-03-16” summary. CLIENT_FEATURES_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS: report date range and CSV export noted as implemented. INCOMPLETE_IMPLEMENTATIONS_ANALYSIS: added “Verified 2026-03-16” for webhook verification, issues permissions, search API, offline queue.
- **Activity feed API date params** — `/api/activity` now returns 400 with a clear message when `start_date` or `end_date` are invalid (e.g. not ISO 8601). Invalid dates on the web route `/activity` are logged and the filter is skipped (no 500).
- **Invoice PEPPOL compliance check** — Exceptions in the PEPPOL compliance block are no longer silently ignored: specific and generic exceptions are caught, logged, and a generic warning (“Could not verify PEPPOL compliance; check configuration.”) is shown to the user so the view still renders.
- **Documentation and i18n audit** — Updated docs and translations to match current implementation: removed stale "coming soon" claims; marked INCOMPLETE_IMPLEMENTATIONS_ANALYSIS as historical and added still-relevant summary; rewrote INVENTORY_MISSING_FEATURES as "Remaining Gaps" (transfers, adjustments, reports, PO management, API are implemented); updated GETTING_STARTED (PDF export, project permissions, REST API); REST_API (webhooks supported); KEYBOARD_SHORTCUTS_SUMMARY (customization implemented); BULK_TASK_OPERATIONS (bulk due date/priority implemented); INVENTORY_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS (report templates done); activity_feed (invoices/clients/comments status clarified). Removed orphaned translation strings "Bulk due date update feature coming soon!" and "Bulk priority update feature coming soon!" from 10 locale `.po` files.

### Added
- **Mileage and Per Diem export and filter (Issue #564)** — Mileage and Per Diem now support CSV and PDF export using the same filter set as the list view, matching Time Entries behavior. **Mileage**: Export CSV and Export PDF buttons in the filter card; exports use current filters (search, status, project, client, date range). Routes: `GET /mileage/export/csv`, `GET /mileage/export/pdf`. PDF report via [app/utils/mileage_pdf.py](app/utils/mileage_pdf.py) (ReportLab, landscape A4, totals row). **Per diem**: Client filter added to the list form (with client-lock/single-client handling); Export CSV and Export PDF buttons; routes `GET /per-diem/export/csv`, `GET /per-diem/export/pdf`. PDF via [app/utils/per_diem_pdf.py](app/utils/per_diem_pdf.py). Export links are built from the current filter form (JS), so applied filters apply to both the list and the downloaded file.
- **Break time for timers and manual time entries (Issue #561)** — Pause/resume running timers so time while paused counts as break; on stop, stored duration = (end − start) − break (with rounding). Manual time entries and edit form have an optional **Break** field (HH:MM); effective duration is (end − start) − break. Optional default break rules in Settings (e.g. >6 h → 30 min, >9 h → 45 min) power a **Suggest** button on the manual entry form; users can override. New columns: `time_entries.break_seconds`, `time_entries.paused_at`; Settings: `break_after_hours_1`, `break_minutes_1`, `break_after_hours_2`, `break_minutes_2`. API: `POST /api/v1/timer/pause`, `POST /api/v1/timer/resume`; timer status and time entry create/update accept and return `break_seconds`. See [docs/BREAK_TIME_FEATURE.md](docs/BREAK_TIME_FEATURE.md).
- **Architecture refactor** — API v1 split into per-resource sub-blueprints (projects, tasks, clients, invoices, expenses, payments, mileage, deals, leads, contacts) under `app/routes/api_v1_*.py`; bootstrap slimmed by moving `setup_logging` to `app/utils/setup_logging.py` and legacy migrations to `app/utils/legacy_migrations.py`. Dashboard aggregations (top projects, time-by-project chart) moved into `AnalyticsService` (`get_dashboard_top_projects`, `get_time_by_project_chart`); dashboard route simplified to call services only. ARCHITECTURE.md updated with module table, API structure, and data flow; DEVELOPMENT.md with development workflow and build steps.

### Fixed
- **Xero integration for apps created after March 2026 (Issue #567)** — OAuth no longer fails with "Invalid scope for client" for Xero Developer apps created on or after March 2, 2026. Replaced deprecated `accounting.transactions` scope with granular `accounting.invoices` and `accounting.payments`. Expense sync now uses the correct `/api.xro/2.0/ExpenseClaims` endpoint (replacing the non-existent `/api.xro/2.0/Expenses`) and reads `ExpenseClaimID` from the response. `_api_request` now accepts an optional request body so invoice and expense payloads are sent to the Xero API. See [docs/integrations/XERO.md](docs/integrations/XERO.md).
- **Time Entries date filter and export (Issue #555)** — Start/End date filters were hard to discover and exports ignored them. The Time Entries overview now has a visible **Apply filters** button in the filter header (next to Clear Filters and Export) so users can apply date and other filters without scrolling. CSV and PDF export links always use the current filter parameters: export href is set from the page URL on load and updated whenever filter form values change, so left-click export, right-click "Open in new tab", and "Save link as" all produce filtered exports. The in-form Apply filters button and the header button both trigger the same filter logic; clicking the header button expands the filter panel if it is collapsed.
- **Log Time / Edit Time Entry on mobile (Issue #557)** — Opening the manual time entry ("Log Time") or edit time entry page on mobile could freeze or crash the browser. The Toast UI Editor (WYSIWYG markdown editor) for the notes field is heavy and causes freezes on mobile Safari/Chrome. On viewports ≤767px we now skip loading the editor and show a plain textarea for notes instead; desktop behavior is unchanged. Manual entry and edit timer templates load Toast UI only when not in mobile view.
- **Stop & Save error (Issue #563)** — Fixed error after clicking "Stop & Save" on the dashboard. The post-timer toast was building the "View time entries" URL with the wrong route name (`timer.time_entries`); the correct endpoint is `timer.time_entries_overview`. Time entries were already saved; the error occurred when rendering the dashboard redirect.
- **Dashboard cache (Issue #549)** — Removed dashboard caching that caused "Instance not bound to a Session" and "Database Error" on second visit. Cached template data contained ORM objects (active_timer, recent_entries, top_projects, templates, etc.) that become detached when served in a different request.
- **Task description field (Issue #535)** — When creating or editing a task, the description field could appear missing or broken if the Toast UI Editor (loaded from CDN) failed to load (e.g. reverse proxy, CSP, Firefox, or offline). A fallback now shows a plain textarea so users can always enter a description; Markdown is still supported when the rich editor loads.
- **ZUGFeRD / PDF/A-3 and PEPPOL (Discussion #433)** — ZUGFeRD embedding no longer silently succeeds without XML when the embed step fails; export is aborted with an actionable error. XMP metadata is created when missing so validators recognize the document. Optional PDF/A-3 normalization (XMP identification and output intent) and optional veraPDF validation gate added. Native PEPPOL transport (SML/SMP + AS4) and strict sender/recipient identifier validation added.

### Added
- **Dashboard time-by-project chart** — "Time by project (last 7 days)" horizontal bar chart on the dashboard (Chart.js); link to Summary report.
- **Summary report charts** — Time-by-project (last 30 days) bar chart and daily trend (last 14 days) line chart on the Summary report page.
- **Summary report PDF export** — New route `/reports/summary/export/pdf`; one-page PDF with today/week/month hours and top projects table ([app/utils/summary_report_pdf.py](app/utils/summary_report_pdf.py)).
- **Post-timer toast** — After stopping the timer, a success toast shows "Logged Xh on [Project]" with an action link "View time entries"; toast manager supports optional `actionLink` and `actionLabel`.
- **Remind to log** — User setting "Remind me to log time at end of day" with time picker (Settings); scheduled task runs hourly and sends one email per day to users who have the reminder enabled and have logged &lt; 0.5h that day (in their timezone). Migration `135_add_remind_to_log_settings` adds `notification_remind_to_log` and `reminder_to_log_time` to users.
- **Migration merge 133** — Merge heads 132 (timesheet governance) and 129 (task tags) so `flask db upgrade` runs without conflicts.
- **PEPPOL native transport** — Transport mode can be set to **Native** (SML/SMP participant discovery + AS4 send) in addition to **Generic** (HTTP JSON access point). Sender and recipient identifiers are validated before send. New settings: `peppol_transport_mode`, `peppol_sml_url`, `peppol_native_cert_path`, `peppol_native_key_path` (Admin → Peppol e-Invoicing).
- **PDF/A-3 and validation** — Option **Normalize ZUGFeRD PDFs to PDF/A-3** and optional **Run veraPDF after export** with configurable path. Migration `130_add_peppol_transport_mode_and_native` adds the new columns.
- **Dashboard timer widget** — Pause and Stop buttons while a timer is running (Pause saves the segment so you can resume later). When no timer is active, a prominent "Resume (project name)" button restarts tracking with the same project/task/notes as your last entry. Quick time adjustment buttons (−15 / −5 / +5 / +15 minutes) let you correct the current session without leaving the dashboard. New route `POST /timer/adjust` for start-time adjustment.

### Changed
- **UI/UX redesign** — Consolidated component system: single `page_header`, `empty_state` / `empty_state_compact`, and `loading_overlay` in `components/ui.html`; migrated overdue tasks page from Bootstrap to Tailwind; added form error and disabled states in design tokens. Base layout: main content max-width (1280px) and centered; first-class **Timer** and **Time entries** in sidebar; reduced nav label weight. Timer flow: single adjust-time form with one submit; dashboard hero is the Timer card (start/stop, quick start, repeat last); post-stop toast with “View time entries” unchanged. Dashboard: Timer as hero block first, then Today/Week/Month stats, then Recent entries (last 5, columns Project/Duration/Date/Actions) with “View all” link to Time entries overview. Empty and loading states use shared macros; toasts used for errors and success. New [UI Guidelines](docs/UI_GUIDELINES.md); README and ARCHITECTURE updated with UI overview and UI layer section.
- **Dashboard** — Weekly goal widget already showed progress bar; added time-by-project (7d) chart and chart data from main route.
- **Summary report** — Added Chart.js time-by-project and daily-trend charts; added Export PDF button; backend passes chart and trend data from AnalyticsService.
- **Toast notifications** — Optional `actionLink` and `actionLabel` in toast manager for action links in toasts.
- **Documentation** — README updated with new features (dashboard chart, summary charts/PDF, post-timer toast, remind to log); daily workflow note in Screenshots section.
- **Log Time Manually page** — Redesigned for a more professional layout: form grouped into sections (Project & task, Date & time, Details) with clear headings and icons; main card uses rounded-xl and shadow-lg; unified label and helper text styling; primary "Log Time" and secondary "Clear" buttons aligned with dashboard button styles; duplicate-entry banner uses rounded-xl.

## [4.20.6] - 2025-02-20

### Changed
- **Version Update** — Updated to version 4.20.6.

## [4.20.5] - 2025-02-17

### Changed
- **Version Update** — Updated to version 4.20.5.

## [4.20.0] - 2025-02-16

### Fixed
- **PDF layout: decorative image persistence and PDF preview (Issue #432)** — Decorative images now survive save/load: image URLs are synced onto groups before generating the template, injected into the saved design JSON using position-based matching, and restored from the saved JSON onto the canvas on load. Empty decorative image elements are no longer added to the ReportLab template, and the PDF generator skips empty or invalid image sources and validates base64 data URIs, preventing a mostly-black or broken PDF preview.
- **Header Start Timer button** — Fixed manual entry URL (`/timer/manual_entry` → `/timer/manual`); timer now correctly opens manual entry when starting from the header button.

### Added
- **Header quick access buttons** — Chat, Timer, and Help are grouped in the header as round icon buttons, vertically aligned and evenly spaced. One-click timer start/stop from any page; Help links to documentation; Chat opens team chat when enabled.
- **ZugFerd / Factur-X support for invoice PDFs** — When enabled in Admin → Settings → Peppol e-Invoicing, exported invoice PDFs embed EN 16931 UBL XML as `ZUGFeRD-invoice.xml`, producing hybrid human- and machine-readable invoices. Uses the same UBL as Peppol; these PDFs can be sent via Peppol or email. New setting `invoices_zugferd_pdf`, migration `128_add_invoices_zugferd_pdf`, dependency `pikepdf`, and [docs/admin/configuration/PEPPOL_EINVOICING.md](docs/admin/configuration/PEPPOL_EINVOICING.md) updated for both Peppol and ZugFerd.
- **Subcontractor role and assigned clients** — Users with the Subcontractor role can be restricted to specific clients and their projects. Admins assign clients in Admin → Users → Edit user (section "Assigned Clients (Subcontractor)"). Scope is applied to clients, projects, time entries, reports, invoices, timer, and API v1; direct access to other clients/projects returns 403. New table `user_clients`, migration `127_add_user_clients_table`, and docs in [docs/SUBCONTRACTOR_ROLE.md](docs/SUBCONTRACTOR_ROLE.md).

### Changed
- **Version Update** — Updated to version 4.20.0.

### Added
- **REST API v1** - CRM and time approvals: `/api/v1/deals`, `/api/v1/leads`, `/api/v1/clients/<id>/contacts`, `/api/v1/contacts/<id>`, `/api/v1/time-entry-approvals` (list, get, approve, reject, cancel, request-approval, bulk-approve). New API token scopes: `read:deals`, `write:deals`, `read:leads`, `write:leads`, `read:contacts`, `write:contacts`, `read:time_approvals`, `write:time_approvals`.
- **Documentation** - Service layer and BaseCRUD pattern ([docs/development/SERVICE_LAYER_AND_BASE_CRUD.md](docs/development/SERVICE_LAYER_AND_BASE_CRUD.md)); RBAC permission model ([docs/development/RBAC_PERMISSION_MODEL.md](docs/development/RBAC_PERMISSION_MODEL.md)).

### Changed
- **API responses** - Projects and new CRM/approvals API v1 routes use standardized `error_response` / `forbidden_response` / `not_found_response` from `app.utils.api_responses`.
- **Templates** - All templates consolidated under `app/templates/`; root `templates/` removed and extra Jinja loader removed.
- **Version** - README, FEATURES_COMPLETE.md, and docs reference `setup.py` as single source of truth for version (4.19.0).
- **Refactored examples** - `projects_refactored_example.py`, `timer_refactored.py`, `invoices_refactored.py` marked as reference-only in module docstrings.
